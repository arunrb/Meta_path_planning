# Meta_path_planning
Collision-Free Autonomous Robot Navigation System Utilizing PSO for Path Planning in Unknown Environment: Particle Swarm Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm was used for mobile robot path planning in an unknown environment with obstacles. The simulated robot employs a LIDAR to scan and build a map of the environment and uses PSO for path planning. The objective function was designed considering the path planning task and the non-holonomic nature of the robot.
